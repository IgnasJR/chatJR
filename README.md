### My attempt at learning NodeJS, SQL, React by creating a simple e2ee chat platform.

### TODO:

#### Pagination:

- [x] Chat starts at bottom
- [x] Loading a limited number of messages at a time
- [x] Scroll to bottom on new message
- [x] Loading more messages on scroll up
- [x] If no messages on appear on scroll up, stop requesting

#### E2EE:

- [x] New styles for 'secret' messages
- [x] Button to enter 'secret' mode
- [x] Implementing E2EE communication using sockets (without storing the messages in the database)
- [x] Fix storing of the private and public keys issue
- [ ] Implement secure AES key exchange

#### Other:

- [x] Fixing UI for mobile
- [x] Adding users using their username, instead of their user_id
- [ ] Adding alerts (sweetalert)
- [x] Log out button
- [x] Time-out for tokens
- [x] Remove conversation
